This repository contains a bunch of plugins written with the After Effects SDK. To install, [download the files](https://github.com/meatbags/after-effects-plugins/tree/master/build) and copy them to your AE plugin directory, for example `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [version]\Support Files\Plug-ins`. If you wish to modify or compile the plugins yourself, you can [get the SDK here](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/aftereffects.html).

# SuperTile
Map video to a tile-sheet (any image really) by hue, saturation, lightness.
