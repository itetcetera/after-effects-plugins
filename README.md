This repository contains all the plugins I've written with the After Effects SDK. To install, [download the files](https://github.com/meatbags/after-effects-plugins/tree/master/build) and copy them to your AE plugin directory, for example `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [version]\Support Files\Plug-ins`. If you wish to modify or compile the plugins yourself, you can [get the SDK here](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/aftereffects.html).

# Halftone
A colour half-tone plugin with lot's of options. Sizes, shapes, and independent channel rotation.

A pixel-sorting Swiss-army-knife. Contains traditional pixel-sorting options, directional and radial sorting, and the option to distort search vectors with a displacement map.

# SuperTile
Map video to a tile-sheet (or any image) by hue, saturation, lightness.

# TimeSort
